# Code Refactor Starter Code
The app is a landing page for horiseon which is a online company that helps optimize customer reach and consumer base.
The title was adjusted to highlight the companies definition better which will help visual detection.
I fixed all broken links so that directs the consumer to be lead to the correct area of the page. 
All links are functioning correctly. 
all images were given an alt tag and a description was given to each.
I was able to rework the CSS style sheet to make it more efficient by consolidating the CSS sectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and included additional comments before each element or section of the page. 
I also adjusted the header HTML as well as the footer. 
the application resembles at least 90% of the screen shots.
